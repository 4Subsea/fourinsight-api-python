###############

The 4insight Python API facilitates authenticated access to resources in `4insight.io`_.
When access is granted, authenticated calls can be done to the `4Insight REST API`_
endpoints.

An authenticated session is necessary input in e.g. the :py:mod:`fourinsight.campaigns.Client`,
that offers a high-level Python API for retrieving campaigns data from 4insight.
